SalesPulse Navigator – Excel Dashboard Project

This project is an end-to-end Sales Analysis Dashboard built using Microsoft Excel.
It helps visualize key business insights such as monthly sales performance, category-wise sales, shipping-mode trends, profit comparison, and customer segmentation.

✅ Project Overview

The SalesPulse Navigator is an interactive Excel dashboard designed to analyze sales data using slicers, charts, pivot tables, and calculated fields.
Users can filter data by Month, Category, Segment, Ship Mode, and Postal Code to get dynamic visual insights.

🛠️ Key Features Implemented
1. Interactive Slicers

I added slicers to filter data instantly:

Order Month

Category

Segment

Ship Mode

Postal Code

Slicers automatically refresh all charts and visuals across the dashboard.

2. Multiple Pivot Tables

Used pivot tables to calculate:

✔️ Sum of Sales

✔️ Sum of Discount

✔️ Average of Sales

✔️ Sum of Quantity

✔️ Sum of Profit

✔️ Adjusted Sales (Calculated Field)

These pivot tables act as the base data for all charts.

3. Professional Visual Charts

I created multiple visuals for a rich analytical experience:

📌 Pie Chart

Shows Sales Distribution by Ship Mode

📌 Clustered Column Chart

Displays Adjusted Sales vs Category by Ship Mode

📌 Bar Chart

Shows Quantity Sold across Different Categories

📌 Line Chart

Visualizes Sales Trend Across Months and Quarters

📌 Profit Chart

Represents Total Profit by Discount Level

Each chart is formatted with a uniform purple theme.

4. Customized Calculations

Created calculated fields such as:

Adjusted Sales = Sales – Discount

Total Sales per Month

Quarterly breakdown using dates

These gave deeper insights beyond the raw dataset.

5. Dashboard Design & Formatting

Used consistent color theme

Added icons, borders, and titles

Designed layout professionally with equal spacing

Applied data validation and cell formatting for clarity

Used alignment, bolding, and labels for readability.
